= RoboWarJS =

A programming game inspired by [RoboWar][robowar], a Mac and Windows game from the 90's, where you would program robots using a simple stack-based language and pit them against each other.

While it is heavily inspired by RoboWar, unlike ports like [JSRoboWar][jsrobowar], this project doesn't aim to replicate the original game or its RoboTalk language.  While the language is very similar, I want to explore different robot mechanics and features.  For example, instead of `speedx` and `speedy` variables, we have `spd` and `heading`.
